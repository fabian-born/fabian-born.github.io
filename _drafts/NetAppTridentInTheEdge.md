# NetApp Trident for ARM is now available !

![environment overview](/trident-in-the-edge.png)

How cool is that ðŸ˜Ž? #ARM support in Astra Trident 2023.04!
 
I tried it right away and deployed NetApp Trident in my #edge environment:
 
âœ” 4 Node #kubernetes cluster on Raspberry PI 3/4.

âœ” ONTAP on-prem and in the #cloud

âœ” Internet Connectivity Router
