View weeks ago AWS and NetApp announced that Astra Trident is now available as an EKS add-on.

A nice step to bring EKS and FSxN together. I will show you how you can enable and use this add-on.

The add-on must first be subscribed to before it can be used. Once everything has been completed, the Astra Trident add-on can be activated. In this short video, you can see all the necessary steps.


Now that Trident has been installed, you can continue with the backend configuration. I will share a small example â€“ but for the complete settings take a look into the [![official documentation](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/trident/trident-use/trident-fsx.html):
