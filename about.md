## About Me
<img align="right" height="183" src="/assets/content/images/fabianborn-neu.jpg">

I’ve been in the IT world for over 25 years now - even if I don’t look like it! Both professionally and privately, I like to deal with new topics such as the cloud, Kubernetes and much more.

In my little HomeLab I test out lots of things, which I will also write about here in my blog!
