## About Me
<img align="right" height="183" src="/assets/images/content/fabianborn-neu.jpg">

I’ve been in the IT world for over 25 years now - even if I don’t look like it! Both professionally and privately, I like to deal with new topics such as the cloud, Kubernetes and much more.

In my little HomeLab I test out lots of things, which I will also write about here in my blog!

If you want to know more of me, check my public profiles:
[LinkedIn][linkedin] / [GitHub][github]

### HomeLab Configuration
In the next few days, I will describe my Homelab in more detail.
